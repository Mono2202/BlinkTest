<!-- USAGE -->
<h2 id="usage"> üêÅ Usage</h2>

<p>
 The program is a basic Forms project, which supports a certain JSON formatting file to fill out the specific forms.
 The JSON file needs to be written with this requirements:
</p>

 * "form_name" key with a form name string
 * "questions" key with the fields name and question
 * "answers" key with the fields name and available answers
 * If there is a needed field for a certain question, the field needs to be written inside an array with the key "needed_fields", and the field needs to be a key after the "needed_fields" key by itself with the correct question
 * If there is a needed field for a certain answer, the needed field needs to be a key inside to the current field, with the correct answer options inside it
 * If an answer consists of only possible answers, the possible answers need to be inside of an array
 * If an answer is an open answer, the value of the field inside the "answers" key needs to be an empty string
 * Questions need to be written with 4 more characters at the end of the string: a space, and [X] where the X is replaced with M - for mandatory question, or an O - for optional question.

<p>JSON Example: </p>

```json
{
    "form_name": "restaurant order",
    "questions":
    {
        "dish": "Choose a dish (pizza / hamburger): [M]",
        "toppings": {
            "needed_fields": ["dish"],
            "dish": {
                "hamburger": "Choose hamburger toppings: [O]",
                "pizza": "Choose pizza toppings: [O]"
            }
        },
        "cooking_level": {
            "needed_fields": ["dish"],
            "dish": {
                "hamburger": "Choose cooking level: [M]"
            }
        }
    },

    "answers":
    {
        "dish": ["pizza", "hamburger"],
        "toppings": {
            "dish": {
                "hamburger": ["pickles", "lettuce", "onions"],
                "pizza": ["olives", "tomatoes"]
            }
        },
        "cooking_level": {
            "dish": {
                "hamburger": ["M", "MW", "WD"]
            }
        }
    }
}
```

In addition to that, you can fill imported forms, just answer the given questions, and the JSON filled form will be saved in the ```filled_forms``` directory.

Imported forms will be saved @ the ```forms``` directory.
